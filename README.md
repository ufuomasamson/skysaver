```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Paystack Configuration (stored in database via admin dashboard)
# No environment variables needed - configure via /admin/dashboard

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Supabase Setup
1. Create a new project in Supabase
2. Set up authentication (Email/Password)
3. Import the database schema using the migration files

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `users` - User accounts with roles
- `flights` - Flight information with tracking numbers
- `bookings` - User bookings with payment status
- `airlines` - Airline information
- `locations` - Airport/city data
- `currencies` - Multi-currency support
- `payment_gateways` - Payment configuration
- `user_preferences` - User settings

### MySQL Database Setup for cPanel
1. **Create the Database**
   - Go to MySQL Databases in cPanel
   - Create a new database named `united_airline` (or your preferred name)
   - Create a new database user with a strong password
   - Add the user to the database with ALL PRIVILEGES

2. **Import Database Structure**
   - Navigate to phpMyAdmin from cPanel
   - Select your newly created database
   - Click on the "Import" tab
   - Upload and execute the comprehensive SQL file:
     - `united_airline_complete_database.sql` - Creates all tables, relationships, and adds sample data
     
3. **Verify Database Setup**
   - Check that all tables were created successfully (should see 10 tables)
   - Verify sample data was imported correctly (locations, airlines, currencies)
   - Test the database connection with your application

## 💳 Payment Flow

### Paystack Payment Flow
1. **User selects flight** → Booking created
2. **User clicks "Pay with Paystack"** → Inline payment modal opens
3. **User enters card details** → Payment processed via Paystack API
4. **Payment completed** → Booking automatically approved
5. **Ticket generated** → Available for download immediately

### Crypto Payment Flow
1. **User selects flight** → Booking created
2. **User clicks "Pay with Crypto"** → Crypto wallet modal opens
3. **User uploads payment proof** → Booking status set to "awaiting approval"
4. **Admin approves payment** → Booking approved and ticket generated

## 🔧 API Endpoints

- **Mastercard**: 5200000000000007
- **Verve**: 5060000000000000005

**⚠️ PRODUCTION WARNING**: In production, all payments are processed with real money using live Paystack API keys.

### Debug Endpoints
- `http://localhost:3000/paystack-debug` - Check Paystack setup and configuration
- `http://localhost:3000/payment-test` - Test payment flow with currency conversion

## 🚀 Deployment

### Truehost cPanel Hosting

We've prepared detailed instructions for deploying this application to Truehost cPanel in the [CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](./CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md) file.

**Quick Overview of Truehost cPanel Deployment:**

1. **Create MySQL Database** in Truehost cPanel's MySQL Database tool (note the username prefix)
2. **Import SQL Files** using phpMyAdmin with the single `united_airline_complete_database.sql` file
3. **Upload Application Files** via Truehost File Manager (compressed ZIP recommended)
4. **Configure Environment Variables** in a `.env` file with your Truehost database credentials
5. **Set Up Node.js Application** using Truehost's Setup Node.js App tool in cPanel
6. **Configure Domain and SSL** for secure access to your application

See the complete step-by-step guide specifically tailored for Truehost in [CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](./CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Stored securely in database, not in client code
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security for all tables
- **Payment Verification**: Server-side validation of all payments
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all inputs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Payment Verification Fails**
   - Check API keys in `/admin/integrations`
   - Verify Flutterwave account is active
   - Check server logs for detailed errors

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify Supabase credentials
   - Check RLS policies
   - Run database migrations

3. **Amount Conversion Issues**
   - Use debug endpoint: `/api/payment/debug-amount`
   - Check currency conversion logic
   - Verify Flutterwave amount format
